/*
This project uses a sqlite db with sequelize orm (http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/latest/).
The database schema is depicted in sql-schema.png.

There are four primary tables:
* users: people who have previously authenticated with slack
* teams: teams with which users have authenticated
* destinations: places that trains are scheduled to visit or have previously visited
* trains: scheduled events

Teams are central to the app and are associated with all other tables. All data displayed to
a logged in user is specific to the team they logged in with. Slack allows users to have
multiple teams, and this app is designed to display primarily team-centric data, rather than
user-centric data. The same user who authenticates with a different team will see different
trains, different destinations, and different teammates by design.

The following associations exist within the db:
* users to teams: m-n (users can have multiple slack teams)
* users to trains: m-n (joiners of train) and 1-m (creator of train)
* teams to destinations: m-n (saved destinations are team-specific)
* teams to trains: m-n (scheduled trains are team-specific)
* destinations to trains: 1-m (trains have one destination, multiple trains can have same dest)
